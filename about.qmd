## Overview

This website automatically aggregates and displays publications from members of the College of MVLS Learning Teaching and Scholarship network. Rather than manually maintaining a list that quickly becomes outdated, we leverage the [ORCID](https://orcid.org) infrastructure to keep our publication list current.

## How It Works

```

1. **Data Source**: Each network member maintains their own ORCID profile with their publications
2. **Automated Fetching**: A weekly GitHub Actions workflow runs an R script that queries the ORCID public API
3. **Deduplication**: Publications that appear on multiple authors' profiles (collaborations) are deduplicated by DOI
4. **SoTL Classification**: Publications are automatically tagged as education-related based on journal names and title keywords
5. **Website Generation**: Quarto renders the data into a searchable, browsable website
6. **Deployment**: The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages

## SoTL Classification

Publications are automatically classified as Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) or education-related using two methods:

### Journal Matching

Publications appearing in known education journals are automatically tagged. The list includes journals across higher education, medical education, science education, and discipline-specific pedagogy journals.

### Keyword Matching

For publications not matched by journal, titles are scanned for education-related terms such as "teaching", "learning", "pedagogy", "curriculum", "assessment", "student", and many others.

This classification is imperfect but provides a useful filter without requiring manual curation. The keyword and journal lists can be expanded by editing `R/fetch_orcid_publications.R`.

## Limitations

- **Only ORCID-indexed publications**: Works not added to ORCID profiles won't appear
- **Metadata quality varies**: Publication details depend on how they were entered in ORCID
- **Weekly updates**: There's up to a 7-day delay between ORCID updates and website updates
- **No full-text**: We only display metadata, not full papers
